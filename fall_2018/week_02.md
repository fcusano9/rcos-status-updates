# Last Week's Accomplishments

I found out that google no longer has an "app" store for chrome apps so there would be no way for my app to be discovered online. Instead of creating just an app I started to create a google extension as well as the app. That way users will be able to see the chrome extension in the extension store. The chrome extension wont be able to have as many features as the app so my plan is to prompt the users to download the app if they would like the additional features.

# This Week's Plan

My plan for the upcoming week is to complete the chrome extension and get it to a point that may allow me to post it on the store although I probably wont post it yet anyway.

# Anything Blocking?

There isn't anything blocking, I have been moving a little slower simply due to the learning curve. I have been spending a lot of my time watching youtube videos.
