# Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I finished up working on the chrome extension to get that fully working. All I have left to do now is add some small functionality and error checking. As well as refine my code and refactor a bit. After I am finished with that I might post my extension to the Chrome app store.

# This Week's Plan

Finish up the extension as well as look into different ways to run the web app other than a Chrome app.

# Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking right now.
