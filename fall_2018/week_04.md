# Last Week's Accomplishments

I starting looking at getting Floating Twitch working on Youtube as well as other websites. Eventually, If I get it working on enough websites I might change the name as my software would not only apply to Twitch. Unfortunately, this past week I was not able to get much work done as I had some tests to study for but I plan on working a lot this coming week and should hopefully make some big progress.

# This Week's Plan

I would like to fix a bug where clicking on the 'fullscreen' icon does not work and causes an error. I am still not sure what is causing it or how to fix it but I plan on working on that this week. I also would like to implement getting this working on Youtube.

# Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking right now.
