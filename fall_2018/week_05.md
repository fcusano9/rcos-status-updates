# Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I have cleaned up a lot of code in order to get it demo ready for my presentation next week. The project is fully functional however still isn't done because there is a lot of little things that need to get ironed out. I also added an input box so that the user can simply type in the twitch stream that they are trying to navigate to instead of having to open twitch first.

# This Week's Plan

Im still not sure on how to do a few things that I would like to do. This week I would like to make it so that when you click the extension icon it open the application view instead of the extension view. The reason for this is because the application allows for a borderless window as well as gives you always-on-top functionality where the extension does not.

# Anything Blocking?

Nothing right now.
