# Last Week's Accomplishments

My app is pretty much complete at this point, this past week I made my presention since I will be presenting on Friday. 

# This Week's Plan

Im still not sure on how to do a few things that I would like to do. This week I would like to make it so that when you click the extension icon it open the application view instead of the extension view. The reason for this is because the application allows for a borderless window as well as gives you always-on-top functionality where the extension does not.

# Anything Blocking?

Nothing right now.
