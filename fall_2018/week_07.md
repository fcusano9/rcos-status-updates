# Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I added instructions to my readme to help people install and run the application. The app has gotten to the point where it is fully functional but the extension definately needs more work.

# This Week's Plan

This week I am going to look into an installer for my chrome app. That way people can easily download and use my app from github. A few people have already expressed interest in using it so it would be nice to be able to install it without having to run Chrome as a developer.

# Anything Blocking?

Nothing right now.
